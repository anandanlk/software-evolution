- add tests in Duplication, Unit Complexity, add results in report
- find another metric in the literature and argue why and how it would improve the results, implement it (e.g. count lines of comments)
- verify results are correct
- scalability
- describe relevant design decisions (thresholds for unit size), 
- accuracy, improvements
- script to run
