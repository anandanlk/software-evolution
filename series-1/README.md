1. Which metrics are used?
    - Volume
    - Unit Complexity
    - Unit Size
    - Duplication
    - Unit Testing
2. How are these metrics computed?
    - Volume:
        - Lines of code without blank lines, line comments and block comments
        - Man years
    - Unit Complexity
    - Unit Size
    - Duplication
    - Unit Testing
3. How well do these metrics indicate what we really want to know about these
systems and how can we judge that?
4. How can we improve any of the above?

Scores:
• Maintainability (overall),
• Analysability,
• Changeability,
• Testability,
• Stability

- create test java project
- describing relevant design decisions, 
- tests,results, 
- and what you did to address threats to validity,
- alternatives,
- scalable, analysis of algorithmic complexity/ empirical analysis
- well-structured, automated tests
- find another metric in the literature and argue why and how it would improve the results
- script to run
